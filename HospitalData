#Hospital Data Analysis 

I have decided to take on the task of analyzing over 100,000 hospital records with a little help from SQL. 
Where should we start? Familiarizing ourselves with the data, of course! 
First, let's take a look at the gender and age breakdown. 



Next, let's examine the diagnoses patients are most commonly being seen for. 


Now that we know what they're being treated for, let's take a look at where they're coming from. 


We know that hospital stays are expensive. Which specialty's patients are staying the longest? 


Nobody wants to see their patients back too soon. We love to help them, but want to make sure they're healthy before we send them home! 
Let's take a look at some factors that are related to higher incidences of readmittance. 
First: the frequent fliers


Do older patients have higher rates of readmittance?
